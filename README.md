# IDD-Fa18-Final_Project
Interactive Art by Karim Arem and Brian Pfaff.

We are introducing a new way to think about and create art by incorporating human movement and arm actions into the creation of it using computer vision on a mobile pi. We believe that by using different colored balls in the users hands, we could turn the creation of art into a more physically active, interactive as well as easier activity where users can use full body movement to draw on a digital white canvas and save it instantly rather than the more expensive task of sitting down and drawing on a physical canvas.
